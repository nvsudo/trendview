# TradeFlow Vision
## The Momentum Trading Journal for India's Next-Gen Traders

### Our Vision
To become India's premier platform for momentum traders who follow proven methodologies, providing them with a simple, powerful journal that connects strategy with community.

### The Problem We're Solving

#### Current Market Gap
- **Fragmented Tools**: Indian traders juggle multiple platforms - Zerodha for execution, external tools for analysis, notebooks for journaling
- **Methodology Disconnect**: No platform specifically built for Weinstein Stage Analysis and Minervini SEPA methodologies popular among momentum traders
- **Isolation**: Successful trading strategies remain siloed; traders lack a community to share learnings and validate approaches
- **Focus Misalignment**: Existing platforms prioritize stock discovery over trade management and learning

#### Specific Pain Points
- Manual trade logging leads to inconsistent journaling
- Difficulty tracking stage analysis across multiple positions
- No structured way to review and learn from past trades
- Limited peer interaction for strategy validation
- Complex, bloated interfaces that distract from core trading activities
